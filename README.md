# Digital Archaeology Notes

---

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to my journey in learning digital and computational archaeology! This space serves as a living document of my progress, notes, small code snippets, and useful resources I discover along the way.

## About This Repository

This repository is a structured learning log where I will:
* Document my understanding of key concepts and methodologies in digital archaeology.
* Store practical notes from online courses, textbooks, and academic papers.
* Keep small, illustrative code snippets (e.g., Python for data manipulation, R for statistical analysis) related to archaeological data.
* Showcase simple examples of data visualizations or spatial analysis outputs.
* Track my progress in learning various software and tools relevant to the field.

## My Current Learning Goals

As I embark on this journey, my primary goals include:
* **Mastering Python for Archaeological Data Analysis:** Focusing on libraries like `pandas` for data handling, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, and `geopandas` for geospatial data.
* **Proficiency in QGIS:** Learning advanced GIS techniques for archaeological site mapping, landscape analysis (e.g., viewshed, least-cost path), and data integration.
* **Understanding 3D Modeling Techniques:** Exploring photogrammetry, laser scanning, and their application in documenting and analyzing archaeological features and artifacts.
* **Introduction to Machine Learning in Archaeology:** Understanding how ML algorithms can be applied for artifact classification, site prediction, or pattern recognition in archaeological datasets.
* **Exploring Database Management:** Learning about structured ways to store and query archaeological information.

## Repository Structure (Planned)

Here's how I envision organizing my notes and files:

* `notes/`: Markdown files containing detailed notes on concepts, software usage, and methodologies.
* `scripts/`: Small, self-contained code scripts demonstrating specific techniques (e.g., a Python script to calculate artifact frequencies).
* `data-samples/`: (Future) May contain very small, non-sensitive sample datasets used in my learning exercises.
* `visualizations/`: (Future) Images or interactive outputs from analyses.
